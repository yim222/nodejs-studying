What and for what we need configuration ?
It's let us to manage in organized way general things that application needs, that depends on external condition like
environment, and not the code itself.

USE CASE -
In development area you want to debug - this mean you want to show logs. At Production you don't want.

From the docs - https://www.npmjs.com/package//config

"Node-config organizes hierarchical configurations for your app deployments.

It lets you define a set of default parameters,
and extend them for different deployment environments (development, qa, staging, production, etc.).

Configurations are stored in configuration files within your application, and can be overridden and extended by environment variables, command line parameters, or external sources.

This gives your application a consistent configuration interface shared among a growing list of npm modules also using node-config.

It's working only from the main file, by npm start, or directly to run file, from the root folder.

U here - next, do a quick video about that...
